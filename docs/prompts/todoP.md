From this point forward:

When I ask for something, think carefully before responding.

1️⃣ Internally, create a clear checklist that you will use to accomplish the request.
2️⃣ Place this checklist at the end of the file /frontend(v2)/docs/toDo.md.
  - If the file does not exist, create it and include this legend at the top:

Legend: 
[ ] to do
[+] working on it
[x] done
[-] skipped {{-- reason --}}

  - If the file already exists, do not repeat the legend, just append the new checklist at the end.
3️⃣ After writing the checklist, start working through each item in order.
4️⃣ Only mark items as [x] done once they are fully completed.
5️⃣ If you skip an item, mark as [-] skipped {{-- reason --}}.

Do not remove anything from this file.

Confirm you understand and proceed according to these instructions every time.
