💣 Weak points
	•	Hover link color (#0af) looks weak and washed out in light mode — too low contrast.
	•	Current hover style is good on dark, but fails on light.
	•	Header nav hover interaction lacks strong visual feedback in light mode.

⚡ Recommended Edits

1️⃣ Define explicit hover colors for each theme

Add to header.css:

body[data-theme='light'] .header__nav-link:hover {
  color: #0056ff; /* Stronger, deeper blue for better contrast on light backgrounds */
}

body[data-theme='dark'] .header__nav-link:hover {
  color: #0af; /* Existing bright blue works well on dark background */
}

2️⃣ (Optional but recommended) Add underline feedback

For extra clarity, add:

.header__nav-link:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-underline-offset: 4px;
}

3️⃣ Verify on all links
	•	Check “Projects,” “Info,” “Contact,” and “Login” in both themes.
	•	Confirm consistent color and hover underline feedback.

✅ Final touch
	•	Light mode hover now has strong, premium contrast.
	•	Dark mode hover remains unchanged and sharp.
	•	Improved visual clarity and interactive feedback.
