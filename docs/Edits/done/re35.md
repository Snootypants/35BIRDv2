üìÑ Concept: Overlapping project tiles on scroll without moving hero

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pin hero section
- Use `position: sticky; top: 0;` or controlled container with a fixed offset
- Ensure z-index is below tiles

2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjust project tiles container
- Set container to `position: relative;`
- Add enough top margin so that tiles initially start below hero

3Ô∏è‚É£ As user scrolls
- Tiles naturally enter viewport and overlap hero
- Hero stays fixed in place

4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Fade hero elements slightly when tiles overlap
- Use intersection observer or scroll event to reduce opacity or add blur

‚úÖ Result: Hero stays locked, tiles appear to "rise" over it.
