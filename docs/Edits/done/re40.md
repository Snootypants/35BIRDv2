# ClaudeC — Project Card Animation & Layout Upgrade

## 🎯 Objective

Refine the project tiles/cards animation and layout for maximum impact.

## 💥 Goals

1️⃣ Lock the **hero section** in place at all times. It does not move or scroll.  
2️⃣ Change card layout from **3+1** to **2+2** (two cards per row).  
3️⃣ Animate cards so they appear to **slide up from the bottom**, as if coming from a keyboard tray onto the screen.  
4️⃣ Animate opacity: start semi-transparent (e.g., 40–50%), end at 100% as they come up.  
5️⃣ Add a subtle **underglow effect** on card hover, no harsh shadows.  

## 💻 Animation Details

- **Transformations:**
  - TranslateY: start at 200px, end at 0px.
  - Scale: start at 0.9, end at 1.
  - (Optional) RotateX: start at 15°, end at 0° for a "stand-up" effect.
- **Opacity:**
  - Start at ~40%, fade to 100% as cards slide up.
- **Perspective:**
  - Use `perspective: 1000px` for 3D feeling if needed.

## 🗂️ Reference Code

Check file: `/exampleCode/cardSlide.md` for sample Framer Motion transforms and structure reference.

## 🧹 Layout Updates

- Update grid to `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);` so cards are arranged as 2+2.
- Adjust card container CSS to handle balanced spacing in both light and dark themes.

## 🔥 Hover Effect

- When hovering a card:
  - Add soft underglow using box-shadow or similar effect.
  - No scaling on hover (unless you decide it's subtle enough to look good).

## 📝 Other

- Keep fluid hero background and animation untouched.
- Do not shift or push hero content.

## ✅ Deliverable

A single, clean, unified implementation that applies to all themes and works in current project structure.
