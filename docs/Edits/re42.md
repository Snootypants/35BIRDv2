# ClaudeC — Card Slide Up, Icon Fade, and Hero Pin Final Fix

## 💣 Issues

- Project icons do not fade in with cards (only show on hover).
- Cards currently appear from static grid position, not from bottom of screen.
- Hero container slightly shifts when cards load.
- Timing of icon fade and card tilt is desynced.

## ✅ Goals

1️⃣ Cards start fully off-screen (translateY: 100vh, rotateX: 90deg, opacity: 0).
2️⃣ On scroll, cards animate to (translateY: 0, rotateX: 0deg, opacity: 1).
3️⃣ Project icon fades in at the same time as card.
4️⃣ Hero container stays fully pinned with no vertical collapse.
5️⃣ Hover glow remains but only adds glow and scale — icon already visible.

## 📄 Where to Work

- `Frontend(v2)/index.html`
- `Frontend(v2)/styles/components/project-cards.css`
- `Frontend(v2)/scripts/cardScroll.js`
- `Frontend(v2)/components/ProjectCard.html` or jsx partial if applicable

## 💡 Key Style Changes

```css
.project-card {
  transform: translateY(100vh) rotateX(90deg);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: transform 0.8s ease, opacity 0.8s ease;
}

.project-card.show {
  transform: translateY(0) rotateX(0deg);
  opacity: 1;
}

.project-card .project-icon {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.8s ease;
}

.project-card.show .project-icon {
  opacity: 1;
}
