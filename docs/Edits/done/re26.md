👨‍💻 Final paranoia-level hygiene pass (deep audit)

We have had multiple issues with leftover CSS slop, conflicting overrides, and untracked variable usage.
I need you to run a full final pass with maximum strictness.

Specifically:

1️⃣ Check every CSS and SCSS file for any local hard-coded color, background, text-shadow, or opacity assignments that override theme variables.
	•	Flag any direct hex codes or rgb() values used outside variables.css.

2️⃣ Ensure every color, shadow, and spacing value references only a token from variables.css.
	•	No exceptions unless explicitly justified in the report.

3️⃣ Verify no hidden fallback colors are set on individual components.

4️⃣ Check for any duplicated or unreachable style blocks.

5️⃣ Provide a final audit report that includes:
	•	What was found (if anything).
	•	Why it’s problematic.
	•	Exact file paths and line numbers.
	•	Suggested fix instructions or removal.

🎯 Goal: Zero local overrides. Fully clean, single source of truth (variables.css). No slop. Future-proof and consistent with possible styleGuide.md adoption.

✅ Deliver the report in a clear, bullet-point format ready to drop into our docs.
