💣 How your system currently works (confirmed from code)
	•	You have a single file: variables.css, which defines a central design token system using CSS variables.
	•	You define:
	•	:root as the base / default / classic theme, which currently acts as your “light” theme.
	•	[data-theme="dark"] for dark theme overrides.
	•	[data-theme="ghibli"] for another variant.
	•	[data-theme="classic"] explicitly says it uses default root values.

⸻

⚡ What actually happens on theme toggle
	•	When toggling, your code updates <body data-theme="...">.
	•	CSS then swaps variables globally depending on [data-theme="..."].
	•	There is no separate “stylesheet swap” (like loading new .css files at runtime); all colors are pre-defined and swapped via variables.

⸻

🟢 What is correct
	•	You do have a central style system (your design token system via CSS variables in variables.css).
	•	Dark theme is properly defined in [data-theme="dark"].
	•	Ghibli is also correctly separated.

⸻

🔴 What’s still missing for light
	•	You rely on :root as “light” by default, but it was never truly refined as a premium light theme.
	•	The default :root variables (light theme) are too basic, lacking nuance, soft backgrounds, accent shadows, etc.

⸻

✅ Verdict

You are correct in spirit — you don’t have a dedicated [data-theme="light"] block. Instead, you’re using :root for “light”, which is exactly what is failing.

⸻

💥 Solution

Create an explicit [data-theme="light"] block

[data-theme="light"] {
  --color-bg-primary: #f4f6f8;
  --color-bg-secondary: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-accent: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  --color-text-primary: #111111;
  --color-text-secondary: #333333;
  --color-text-muted: #666666;
  --color-border: #d0d4d9;
  --color-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
  --color-shadow-heavy: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}


⸻

⚡ How to apply
	•	Move your current :root values into [data-theme="light"].
	•	Then, create a new refined :root if needed (or keep it empty as fallback).

⸻

🟢 Benefits
	•	You get a true, explicitly tunable light theme, not a fallback default.
	•	Consistency and maintainability improve massively.
	•	All further changes become one-liners in variables.css.

⸻

💣 Problem
	•	No explicit [data-theme="light"] block; using :root as light, which lacks premium design tokens.

⚡ Recommended Edits

1️⃣ Create [data-theme="light"] block in variables.css

[data-theme="light"] {
  --color-bg-primary: #f4f6f8;
  --color-bg-secondary: #ffffff;
  --color-bg-accent: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  --color-text-primary: #111111;
  --color-text-secondary: #333333;
  --color-text-muted: #666666;
  --color-border: #d0d4d9;
  --color-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
  --color-shadow-heavy: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}


⸻

2️⃣ Move default “light” colors from :root into this block.

⸻

3️⃣ Optionally reset :root to only hold fallback or common values.

⸻

✅ Result
	•	Proper style guide separation.
	•	Smooth, premium light theme.
	•	Dark and light both equally robust.
