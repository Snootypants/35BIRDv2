## 🎨 Task 1: Adjust header/navigation bar transparency

Target: Frontend(v2)/styles/components/header.css

Steps:
1️⃣ Locate the background color on `.header` or `.header-container`.
2️⃣ Update to slightly more transparent:
   - For dark theme: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85) → rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)
   - For light theme: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9) → rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)
3️⃣ Leave link and icon text colors untouched.

Goal: Subtle increased transparency while maintaining good readability.

## 🗑️ Task 2: Remove theme debug label under “35BIRD”

Target file(s): index.html and any linked header components

Steps:
1️⃣ Locate the element displaying the theme indicator text (e.g., `<span class="theme-label">LIGHT</span>` or similar).
2️⃣ Delete or comment out this markup completely.
3️⃣ Remove any related CSS styling if it exists in header.css or typography.css.

Goal: Theme label is no longer displayed. Page looks final and polished.

✅ Final checks:
- Verify header is slightly more transparent and fully functional in both light and dark modes.
- Confirm no theme label text remains anywhere.
