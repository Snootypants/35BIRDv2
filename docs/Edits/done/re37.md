# üîß CLAUDEC DIRECTIVE: Final hero lock + project card background refinement

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix hero section position

- File: Frontend(v2)/layouts/page.css (or wherever hero container CSS is defined)
- Change the hero section to stay fixed (not scroll up).
- Use: `position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; z-index: appropriate value to stay behind cards but above background fluid.`
- Hero should stay centered and static as cards scroll up and over it.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update project card backgrounds

- File: Frontend(v2)/styles/components/cards.css (or wherever cards are styled)
- Remove high transparency from card backgrounds.
- Set background to solid or semi-solid dark: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85)` or similar.
- Keep existing card border glow or outline if desired, but avoid translucent body.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove "Featured Projects" text

- File: Frontend(v2)/index.html (or the layout file containing this text)
- Remove or comment out the `<h2>` or similar heading for "Featured Projects" since it's redundant when cards overlap hero.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Check z-index and stacking order

- Ensure hero stays visually behind cards when scrolled.
- Cards must maintain correct hover and glow interactions.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Final polish

- Verify no new horizontal scrollbars or layout shifts introduced.
- Test both light and dark themes to confirm no contrast or readability issues.

## Expected outcome

- Hero logo and text stay locked and never move.
- Cards slide up clearly, with solid presence.
- Overall aesthetic: clean, premium, and intentional.
