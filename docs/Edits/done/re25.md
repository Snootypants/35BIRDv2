👨‍💻 Task: Code hygiene audit for slop and redundant assignments

I need you to perform a deep cleanup pass focused on removing “slop” (leftover, redundant, or conflicting code).

Specifically:

1️⃣ Identify and list all CSS variables or property values that are assigned multiple times across different files or sections.
	•	Example: color: var(--color-text-primary); being overridden locally in a component file.

2️⃣ Flag any local style overrides that should be consolidated into our global theme variables in variables.css.
	•	These local assignments create conflicts and partial behavior. We want everything driven by central tokens.

3️⃣ Check for legacy or unused CSS rules that no longer apply (e.g., opacity hacks, shadow tweaks, background overlays).
	•	Especially any leftover from earlier phases or dark/light mode transitions.

4️⃣ Cross-check that no component file is redefining values that already exist in variables.css.

5️⃣ Provide a concise report:
	•	What was found.
	•	Why it’s problematic.
	•	Exact file and line locations.
	•	Suggested cleanup or removal instructions.

🎯 Goal: Ensure fully centralized styling logic, no “crumb” overrides, no conflicting assignments. Code should be clean, maintainable, and predictable.
