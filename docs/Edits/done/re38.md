# ClaudeC ‚Äî Full Page Unification & Scroll Fix Directive

## üéØ Problem

- Currently, dark mode and light mode are handled using separate HTML files and diverged CSS/JS logic.
- As a result, edits to hero behavior, card scroll behavior, and component styling are only applied to one mode at a time.
- In dark mode, project cards do not slide up correctly because of conflicting markup and incomplete shared layout logic.

## üó∫Ô∏è Goals

1Ô∏è‚É£ Collapse into a single HTML entry point (preferably `index.html`).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Unify shared CSS (hero, cards, global layout) so all changes work in both themes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Move all theme differences to CSS variables only.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fix scroll behavior to ensure cards slide up over hero consistently across both themes.

## üí• Tasks

### 1. Merge HTML

- Consolidate all markup into one `index.html`.
- Remove `fluid.html`, `fluid-light.html`, or any variant pages.
- Move necessary elements (scripts, theme toggles, hero markup) to the unified file.

### 2. Centralize CSS

- Remove duplicated or diverged CSS in `/styles/`.
- Create/keep a single `variables.css` file with:

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: #000;
  --color-text: #fff;
  /* other base vars */
}
[data-theme="light"] {
  --color-bg: #fff;
  --color-text: #000;
  /* other overrides */
}
