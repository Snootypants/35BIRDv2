What’s wrong

Hero title has a local color: var(--color-text-primary); which conflicts with gradient styles.

Why it’s wrong

When you use a text gradient with background-clip, the local color: line can override or break the transparent gradient effect.

Where it’s wrong

Frontend(v2)/styles/base/typography.css, inside .hero__title block.

Recommended fix

Remove the color: line entirely if gradient is active, or separate it per theme.

.hero__title {
  /* Remove this line if gradient used */
  /* color: var(--color-text-primary); */
}

#2

What’s wrong

Hero title has a faint text-shadow globally applied.

Why it’s wrong

It is too weak to support readability when using gradient text, and may look muddy on certain backgrounds.

Where it’s wrong

Frontend(v2)/styles/base/typography.css, inside .hero__title block.

Recommended fix

Either remove text-shadow or define stronger, theme-specific shadow.

Example stronger version for light mode:

body[data-theme="light"] .hero__title {
  text-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}

✅ Summary
	•	These are the only remaining points after your full cleanup.
	•	Fixing them will finalize all the text and gradient conflicts.
