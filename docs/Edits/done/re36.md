Target: Frontend(v2)/layouts/tiles container and hero area

1️⃣ Remove the black background from the tiles container
- Set background to transparent
- Remove any shadows or backdrop

2️⃣ Remove "Featured Projects" text element
- Delete or comment out from HTML
- Remove corresponding CSS

3️⃣ Make sure tiles slide up over hero smoothly
- Keep hero elements fixed or semi-fixed (logo, big text, subtext)
- Tiles should move up as user scrolls without pushing hero away

Result: Clean, modern slide-over effect with no heavy black block.

Optional: If tiles overlap too abruptly, you can add a small fade-in or shadow behind tiles, but recommend trying without first.
