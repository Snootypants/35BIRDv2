# ClaudeC — Final Card Animation & Background Simplification Directive

## 🎯 Goals

✅ Remove all "stand up" (rotateX) effects from project card scroll animations.  
✅ Animate project cards purely with vertical slide (translateY) and opacity fade.  
✅ Cards start fully below viewport (translateY: 100vh, opacity: 0), then animate to translateY: 0 and opacity: 1 as they enter view.  
✅ Remove or set project cards wrapper container background to fully transparent, so the animated fluid hero background shows through cleanly.  
✅ Keep hero container pinned and unaffected by scroll.  
✅ Retain current hover underglow effect on cards.

## 💥 Tasks

### 1️⃣ Update Scroll Animation Logic

- Remove any rotateX logic from scroll triggers.
- In `Frontend(v2)/scripts/cardScroll.js`:

```js
// Example animation start states
element.style.transform = 'translateY(100vh)';
element.style.opacity = '0';

// On show class toggle
element.classList.add('show');
```

---

### 2️⃣ Update Project Card CSS

In `Frontend(v2)/styles/components/project-cards.css`:

```css
.project-card {
  transform: translateY(100vh);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: transform 1s ease-out, opacity 1s ease-out;
}

.project-card.show {
  transform: translateY(0);
  opacity: 1;
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Fix Container Background

In `Frontend(v2)/styles/components/project-cards.css` or global layout CSS:

```css
.projects-wrapper {
  background: transparent !important;
}
```

Remove any black or dark backgrounds from `.projects-wrapper` or container wrappers.

---

### 4️⃣ Confirm Hero Pinned

- Keep `.hero` section pinned and visually fixed.
- Make sure project card scroll behavior does not push or affect hero container.

---

### 5️⃣ Preserve Hover Glow

Retain existing hover effect:

```css
.project-card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 12px var(--glow-color);
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

`--glow-color` already works per theme.

---

## ✅ Deliver

- Smooth, purely vertical project card slide-in on scroll.
- Clean, transparent background behind cards.
- Hero remains pinned.
- Hover glow fully intact.
