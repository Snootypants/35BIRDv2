Perfect! I've successfully flipped the colors to create a white background version of the fluid simulation. Here are the key changes I made:

## Main Changes:

1. **Background Colors**: Changed from black (`#000`) to white (`#fff`) in CSS and WebGL clear color from `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)` to `(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)`

2. **Text Colors**: Updated all text elements to use dark colors:
   - Main text: `#1a1a1a` (dark gray)
   - Subtitle: `#374151` (medium gray)
   - Instructions: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)` (semi-transparent black)

3. **Button Styling**: Adjusted the CTA button to use dark borders and backgrounds suitable for the white theme

4. **Color Inversion in Shader**: Added a crucial line in the display shader:
   ```glsl
   // Invert the colors for white background
   c = vec3(1.0) - c;
   ```
   This inverts the fluid colors so they appear as colorful streams against the white background instead of the original black.

5. **Background Color Config**: Updated the `BACK_COLOR` configuration to `{ r: 1.0, g: 1.0, b: 1.0 }` for white

The fluid simulation now displays beautiful colored fluid streams against a clean white background, making it perfect for light-themed websites or presentations. The physics and interactivity remain exactly the same - you can still move your mouse to stir the fluid and click for splashes!
