✅ Successfully implemented scroll-up 3D card animation fix per re41.md specifications

**Key Modifications:**
1. **Hero Section**: Confirmed already pinned with `position: fixed` - no changes needed
2. **3D Card Animation**: Updated to use rotateX transformation for "standing up" effect:
   - Initial state: `translateY(50px) rotateX(90deg) opacity(0)`

### Quick Fix - Card Visibility Issue on Load

**Problem**: Cards were invisible on page load (including images) because they started with `opacity: 0` and `rotateX(90deg)` but intersection observer wasn't triggering properly.

**Solution**: Added fallback logic to setupCardAnimations() function:
- Improved intersection observer with proper card indexing for staggering
- Added viewport check fallback that triggers after 100ms if cards are already visible
- Increased rootMargin from 50px to 100px for better detection

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `setupCardAnimations()` in `/index.html` with fallback viewport detection
- Cards now animate properly on page load when already in viewport

**Result**: Cards (including images) now appear correctly on page load with proper 3D animation.

   - Updated fallback logic to account for new 100vh starting position
   - Better viewport detection for dramatic effect timing
4. **Perfect Synchronization**: Updated transition timing:
   - Unified card and icon animations to both use `0.8s ease-out`

### Quick Fix - Tile Animation Issues

**Problems**: 
- Only first row of tiles showing (second row not animating)
- Had to scroll too much before tiles appeared (100vh was too far)
- Opacity animations were causing visibility issues

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduced Starting Distance**: Changed from `translateY(100vh)` to `translateY(150px)` - more reasonable distance
2. **Removed Opacity Animations**: Set all cards and images to `opacity: 1` always - no more fade effects
3. **Improved Detection**: Increased `rootMargin` to `300px` and updated fallback logic for better tile detection
4. **Fixed Staggering**: Intersection observer now properly detects all tiles regardless of row position

**Changes Made**:
- `/styles/components/card.css`: Updated initial transform and removed opacity animations
- `/index.html`: Enhanced intersection observer margins and fallback detection

**Result**: All tiles now animate properly with shorter scroll distance, no opacity issues, and both rows animate correctly.

**Completed Stages:**
1. **Vite + React + TypeScript Project**: Created new project at `/35bird-react/` with proper scaffolding
2. **TailwindCSS Configuration**: Set up Tailwind with content paths, PostCSS config, and base directives
3. **shadcn/ui Integration**: Manually configured shadcn/ui with components.json, utils function, theme colors, and CSS variables
4. **Animation/Icon Libraries**: Added framer-motion and lucide-react to package.json dependencies

**Key Files Created:**
- `/35bird-react/` - New React project directory
- `tailwind.config.js` - TailwindCSS configuration with shadcn/ui theme
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `components.json` - shadcn/ui configuration
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions for component styling
- Updated `src/index.css` - TailwindCSS directives and CSS variables
- Updated `package.json` - Added framer-motion and lucide-react dependencies

**Status**: Ready to proceed with asset migration and component conversion phases

**Next Steps**: 
- Migrate static assets from original project
- Convert HTML structure to React components
