üë®‚Äçüíª Task: Create comprehensive design system docs

We just completed a full audit and cleanup of our CSS and theme system. Now I need you to produce the foundational documentation to lock this in and prevent future drift.

Specifically:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create /docs/styleGuide.md
	‚Ä¢	Describe overall design philosophy (centralized variables, no local overrides).
	‚Ä¢	Explain usage of global tokens.
	‚Ä¢	Include guidance on gradients, shadows, spacing, header and nav styling.
	‚Ä¢	Include naming conventions and general best practices for consistency.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create /docs/theme-map.md
	‚Ä¢	List each theme (e.g., dark, light, ghibli, classic).
	‚Ä¢	For each theme, document which variable values are unique or overridden.
	‚Ä¢	Provide clear summary tables for quick reference.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create /docs/variables-map.md
	‚Ä¢	List every variable from variables.css.
	‚Ä¢	Describe what each variable controls (e.g., text primary color, background primary, border, shadows).
	‚Ä¢	Show default value, example usage, and any theme-specific overrides.

‚úÖ Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Use clean markdown, no fluff.
	‚Ä¢	Provide file paths and example code snippets where relevant.
	‚Ä¢	Make each document easy for future devs to understand and follow.

üéØ Goal: Create a clear, enforceable design system foundation. No more style drift or local overrides. One source of truth.
