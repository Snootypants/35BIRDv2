# ClaudeC ‚Äî Scroll-Up 3D Card Animation Fix (Final)

## üß† Context

We are redesigning the hero section and project card layout.

- Hero must remain pinned (fixed) during scroll.
- Cards should **fade in** and **slide up** from the bottom while **tilting forward** slightly (like they‚Äôre standing up from a desk).
- The existing scroll and animation logic needs to support both dark and light themes.
- Project cards should eventually **sit still** after standing up into place.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

### 1. Ensure Hero is Pinned

- The hero container (`.hero`) should not move during scroll.
- Use `position: sticky` or scroll-blocked JS logic to lock it in place visually.

### 2. Scroll-Triggered Card Animation

- Animate each `.project-card` so that:
  - It starts with:
    - `opacity: 0`
    - `transform: translateY(50px) rotateX(90deg)`
  - As it enters viewport, transitions to:
    - `opacity: 1`
    - `transform: translateY(0) rotateX(0deg) scale(1.05)`
- Use `IntersectionObserver` or `framer-motion` or manual JS logic to coordinate scroll ‚Üí transform.

### 3. UnderGlow Effect

- On hover, add glow:
```css
.project-card:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 12px var(--glow-color);
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
